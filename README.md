## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

This application is built as a full-stack Next.js project, leveraging its features to create a cohesive and performant experience.

-   **Frontend**: The user interface is built with **React** and **TypeScript**. Components from **shadcn/ui** provide the building blocks, which are styled with **Tailwind CSS**. **Framer Motion** is used for UI animations. The entire frontend is client-side rendered and interacts with the backend through API calls.

-   **Backend (API Routes)**: The backend logic is handled by **Next.js API Routes**. These serverless functions are responsible for all communication with the database and external services. This includes all CRUD operations for transactions and proxying requests to the Google Gemini API.

-   **Database**: **MongoDB** serves as the database. A single, cached connection instance is managed in `lib/mongodb.ts` to ensure efficient database communication from the serverless API routes.

-   **Authentication Flow**: **Firebase Authentication** handles user identity. When a user signs up or logs in, Firebase provides a user object. A client-side `AuthContext` uses the `onAuthStateChanged` listener to manage the user's session state globally across the application, protecting routes and personalizing the user experience.

-   **AI Integration**: The AI features are powered by the **Google Gemini API**. The backend API route `/api/ask-ai` securely handles requests, fetches user data, constructs a detailed prompt, and sends it to the Gemini API, returning only the AI's response to the client.
